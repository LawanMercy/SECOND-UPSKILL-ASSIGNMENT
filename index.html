    <h3>What are the Types of Htag's?</h3>
    <h4>
      HTML offers hierarchical levels of headings, marked using h1, h2, h3, h4,
      h5, to h6 tags, with the h1 being the most important headings and the h6
      being the least important.
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        h1: This is the highest-level heading and typically represents the main
        title of the page or the most important heading.
      </li>
      <li>
        h2: This tag is used for secondary headings, often representing major
        sections within the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        h3: These headings are used for sub-sections within the content,
        providing further structure and organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        h4, h5, and h6: These tags represent lower levels of headings, with h4
        being less important than h3, h5 being less important than h4, and so
        on. They are used for finer levels of organization within the content.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
      Heading tags enhance webpage structure, readability, and accessibility,
      while also playing a crucial role in search engine optimization by
      indicating content hierarchy and importance.

      What Distinguishes Normal HTML Elements from Semantic HTML Elements?
      Explain the Disparity between Closing Tags and Self-closing Tags in HTML.
      What Distinguishes Inline Elements from Block Elements in HTML?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Normal HTML elements, such as div, span, p, img, etc. are used to
      structure and format content on a webpage without providing semantic
      information to a browser or search engine. These elements are versatile
      and can be styled and manipulated in various ways using CSS and
      JavaScript. Semantic HTML elements, like header, nav, main, article,
      section, footer, etc. are used to convey meaning and purpose of content,
      making it more accessible and useful for users, hereby providing both
      usability and SEO. In HTML, normal elements typically require both an
      opening and a closing tag to enclose content. For example: p This is a
      paragraph. /p Self-closing tags are standalone elements without content,
      requiring no separate closing tag. For example:
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />

      Inline elements in HTML, such as span, a, img, strong, em, etc. are used
      within block-level elements to style or apply functionality to specific
      content parts without starting on a new line. Block-level elements, such
      as div, p, h1 to h6, are used to structure webpage layouts and create
      distinct content blocks.
