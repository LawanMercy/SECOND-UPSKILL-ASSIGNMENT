    <h3>What are the Types of Htag's?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML offers hierarchical levels of headings, marked using h1, h2, h3, h4,
      h5, to h6 tags, with the h1 being the most important headings and the h6
      being the least important.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        h1: This is the highest-level heading and typically represents the main
        title of the page or the most important heading.
      </li>
      <li>
        h2: This tag is used for secondary headings, often representing major
        sections within the content.
      </li>
      <li>
        h3: These headings are used for sub-sections within the content,
        providing further structure and organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        h4, h5, and h6: These tags represent lower levels of headings, with h4
        being less important than h3, h5 being less important than h4, and so
        on. They are used for finer levels of organization within the content.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Heading tags enhance webpage structure, readability, and accessibility,
      while also playing a crucial role in search engine optimization by
      indicating content hierarchy and importance.
