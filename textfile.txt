      Explain the Disparity between Closing Tags and Self-closing Tags in HTML.
      What Distinguishes Inline Elements from Block Elements in HTML?
    
    
      Normal HTML elements, such as <div>, <span>, <p>, <img>, etc. are used to
      structure and format content on a webpage without providing semantic
      information to a browser or search engine. These elements are versatile
      and can be styled and manipulated in various ways using CSS and
      JavaScript while Semantic HTML elements, like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>,
      <section>, <footer>, etc. are used to convey meaning and purpose of content,
      making it more accessible and useful for users, hereby providing both
      usability and SEO.
      
      In HTML, normal elements typically require both an opening and a closing tag to enclose content. For example: <p This is a
      paragraph. </p> and Self-closing tags are stand alone elements without content,requiring no separate closing tag. For example:
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />

      Inline elements in HTML, such as <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>, etc. are used within block-level elements to style or apply functionality to specific
      content parts without starting on a new line while block-level elements, such as <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, are used to structure webpage layouts and create
      distinct content blocks.
